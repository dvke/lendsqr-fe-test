## Technology Stack:

- **Next.js:** This React framework was chosen for its server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities. SSR improves initial page load performance and SEO by providing pre-rendered HTML to the browser. Additionally, Next.js offers a well-defined file-based routing system and features for data fetching, making it a great choice for building scalable single-page applications (SPAs).
- **SCSS Modules:** SCSS Modules were utilized for styling, offering modularization and encapsulation of styles, which enhances maintainability and reduces the risk of style conflicts.
- **React Tanstack Tables:** This library provides a powerful and flexible component for building complex tables in React applications. It offers features like sorting, filtering, pagination, and customization options, making it a valuable tool for displaying large datasets.
- **Mockaroo:** Easy to use mock API solution. Used to create a mock API endpoint with 500 user records.
- **Local Storage:** Used to store and retrieve user details on the user details page.
- **Netlify:** Used to host the project.
